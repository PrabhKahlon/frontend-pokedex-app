# React Tailwind Pokédex

This Pokédex web application allows users to explore and search for information about different Pokémon. It provides an interactive interface to browse through a list of Pokémon, view their details, and search for specific Pokémon by name.

The Pokedex application was developed by me. It is a personal project for learning TypeScript and practicing front-end development using React and Tailwind.

## Features

- **Pokémon List**: View a list of Pokémon with their names and images.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Load more Pokémon as you scroll down the page for seamless browsing.
- **Pokémon Details**: Click on a Pokémon to view detailed information, including their types, stats, abilities, and evolution chain.
- **Search**: Search for Pokémon by name using the search box.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Each Pokémon has its own unique URL, allowing users to share and bookmark specific Pokémon details pages.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
